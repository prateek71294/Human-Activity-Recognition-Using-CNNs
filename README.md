# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-CNNs
This dataset is taken from https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php 

The dataset is a collection of accelerometer data taken from a smartphone that various people carried with them while conducting six different exercises (Downstairs, Jogging, Sitting, Standing, Upstairs, Walking). For each exercise the acceleration for the x, y, and z axis was measured and captured with a timestamp and person ID. With this available data, we would like to train a neural network in order to understand if a person carrying a smartphone is performing any of the six activities.

The task sounds a bit scary at first but the problem is simpler once the data is preprocessed and prepared for feeding into the model. A very simple structure of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) is used for this particular problem and were able to get an accuracy of 96.5%.
